# jlox
My implementation of jlox, the Java Interpreter for Bob Nystrom's Lox language (https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

I will probably hack out my own additions for fun over time, but at some point that might drift more toward the clox interpreter.
Anyone can use or reference this code :). I'm just kind of hacking as I go for the fun and learning!
